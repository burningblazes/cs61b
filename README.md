# CS61B
My solutions to UCB CS61B Fall 2024. Lab 04 is skipped.

## Materials
Course website: https://fa24.datastructur.es

Textbook: https://cs61b-2.gitbook.io/cs61b-textbook

## Tips
### Lab 01 - how to set up
- Do NOT follow everything about git and github. Just clone the skeleton to your local machine.
- DO follow the IntelliJ part. However, if there is warning message like "Package xxxx does not exist.", go to 'File -> Project Structure' and select 'Libraries' under 'Project Settings' tab. Clickã€€'+' and choose 'Java' to add the 'library-fa24' folder into your project structure. I do this to every lab and project.

### Project 2b
- The data file is accessible here: https://sp23.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2b/ as links of other semesters block non-UCB users.
