## How to setup (Tips on lab 1)
- Do NOT follow everything about git and github. Just clone the skeleton to your local machine.
- DO follow the IntelliJ part. However, if there is warning message like "Package xxxx does not exist.", go to 'File -> Project Structure' and select 'Libraries' under 'Project Settings' tab. Clickã€€'+' and choose 'Java' to add the 'library-fa24' folder into your project structure. I do this to every lab and project.
